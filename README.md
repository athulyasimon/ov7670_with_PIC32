## Interfacing the OV7670 with the PIC32

The goal of this project was interface the OV7670 camera with the PIC32MX595F512L microncontroller (housed in the NU32 Development Board). A full write up can be found on my [portfolio page](http://athulyasimon.github.io/project_portfolio/projects/a_camera_pic/)

The pin Connections between the PIC32 and the camera can be seen below
